        <h3>food prepared by an organism using simple inorganic compnents</h3>
            Green plants,green algae and blue green algae(Cynabacteria) and certain bacteria prepare there food with in their body.<br>
            Green plants and algae prepare there food by the process of photosynthesis.<br>
            Green plants take:- <br>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    CO<sub>2</sub> from air.<br>
                </li>
            </ol>   
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Water(H<sub>2</sub>O) from soil throuth roots
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Chorophyll(Green pigment present in leaves)
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Energy(from sunlight) and then produce food(Glucose/C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>)
                </li>
            </ol>
        <h3>How does CO<sub>2</sub> enters into leaves?</h3>
        <h3>At upper and lower surface of leaves have very small pores in them which are called stomata</h3>
        A daigram of stomata:- <br>
        <img src="phsst.png"><br>
        Oxygen<-Photosynthesis->Carbon Dioxide <br>
        <h3>How does water reaches to leaves?</h3>
        <h3>Water rises through a pulling force called transpirational pull caused due to less of water from leaves.</h3>
        <h3>transpiration:- loss of water through leaves in plants.</h3>  
        *This loss of water also takes through stomata. <br>
        *Plants have cell organelle(Component of cells)in them called chloroplast. <br>
        *chloroplast traps solar energy (from sunlight) Chlorophyll. <br>
